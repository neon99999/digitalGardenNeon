## Overview

World music, non-western music, or music from countries other than Canada, the USA, or England – call it what you will, the world is brimming with diverse musical expressions, much of which remains unheard outside its country of origin.

## Why I Am Interested in World Music

Exposing oneself to music from other countries is a humbling experience. It serves as a reminder that the world is much larger than we often realize, and there are incredible things happening beyond our immediate awareness. This concept aligns with the idea of being [[Catch All/Humbled By the World\|Humbled By the World]].

Furthermore, as a music enthusiast, delving into non-western music has significantly broadened my sonic landscape. Discovering world music has enriched my life with an array of extraordinary sounds and styles.

It's humbling to acknowledge that our music isn't the only kind, and other cultures offer unique and impressive musical contributions. It's important to recognize that the rest of the world exists, creates remarkable music, and deserves our attention.
