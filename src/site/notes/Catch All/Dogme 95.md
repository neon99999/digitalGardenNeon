### Overview

Dogme 95 is a film movement started in 1995 by Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg. 

### Vows of Chastity
The core rules, known as the "Vow of Chastity," are:

1. **Shooting must be done on location**: No sets or props.
2. **Sound must never be produced apart from the images**: No use of external music or sound effects.
3. **The camera must be handheld**: No stabilization equipment.
4. **The film must be in color**: No special lighting or optical work.
5. **Optical work and filters are forbidden**: The camera records only natural light.
6. **The film must not contain superficial action**: No murders, weapons, etc.
7. **Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden**: The film takes place here and now.
8. **Genre movies are not acceptable**: The film must not belong to a specific genre.
9. **The film format must be Academy 35 mm**: To ensure the film's quality.
10. **The director must not be credited**: To promote the film, not the director.

These rules were designed to encourage simplicity, purity, and truth in filmmaking.
