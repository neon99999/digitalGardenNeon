> [!TIP]+ Basically wikipedia but it's just about me. :p

## What
A work in progress, an ongoing collection and a place to practise [[Learning In Public\|Learning In Public]].  A place to remember and a place to organize. 
Nothing published here is a final statement, in fact most of these are only half-baked ideas...but some stuff is real deep too. 

## How
I'm using Obsidian, along with [Ole Eskild Steensen](https://ko-fi.com/oleeskild)'s "Digital Garden" community plugin, to publish a static website from Markdown files through Vercel.I don't know much about Vercel, but it is hosting this website and interfacing with the plug-in. 

## Zettlecasten Method
I'm loosely following the Zettelkasten method to organize and connect thoughts using notes and links. Very similar to wikipedia with ideas split into smaller concepts with their own entries. 

## Level of Certainty
Sharing my certainty allows you to know where I stand with the idea. It also encourages me to share without filtering or refining too much. 

It also allows me, as a writer, to put out things I am still processing.
