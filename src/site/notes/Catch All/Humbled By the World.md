## Overview

Exposing yourself to cultures, music, food, people, and languages outside your usual lifestyle is a humbling and enriching experience. It not only makes you a better person but also provides additional sources of joy and happiness in your life.

## The Things We Know

When peopleâ€™s minds, bodies, and interests are confined to one culture, territory, or sphere of influence, they may start to believe that the only 'good,' 'correct,' or 'virtuous' things come from their own background or the ideas they associate with. This kind of echo chamber or social bubble can lead to various problems. It's fairly safe to say that much of the discrimination and hate in the world stems from the belief that one's own perspective is right and others are wrong, or from the notion that one's culture or identity epitomizes what is right or just, while the 'other' is excluded from this.

## The Things We Don't Know

Exposing yourself to other cultures or ideas can help you realize that your way of seeing the world isn't the only way. In fact, there may be other perspectives that offer more benefits to you or others. Traveling, especially to non-Western countries, can provide a new outlook on life with profound impacts. It humbles you, taking your confident ego and making you think, "Wow, I thought I was cool, but those people over there are cool too, maybe even cooler." There is joy in learning, growing, and stepping outside of our comfort zone. Why not give it a try?

## Ego Quest

This realization that your way may not be the only way can be challenging, and it's likely the source of many people's fear of travel. We are inherently afraid of the foreign and the different. Partly, this is due to concerns about personal, physical safety, but also because **we fear for the integrity of our ego and are concerned about the stability of our fragile sense of self.**

The grip we want to maintain on ourselves and our sense of emotional stability is a strong driving force. Our brain resists confusion, challenges, and the idea that its beliefs might be incorrect. Challenging our perspectives not only broadens our understanding but also fosters empathy and connection in the world.
