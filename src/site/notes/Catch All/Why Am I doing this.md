### TLDR
- I want to be more present online but need control of my digital being.
- I like the freedom of websites over sketchy social media platforms - don't steal my vibes Zucker Musk!
- My career will benefit from having a place to showcase my work.
- I want to share and learn
- I want to tackle the scroll-norms. Give those thumbs a rest!
- If you're interested, I'm using a free and simple program to create this.

#### Ongoing Debate with Online Presence and Social Media
I've stayed away from social media for several years for various reasons, leading to minimal sharing of my work and personal life online. I want to have an online presence but I want to do it on my own terms and not through the dirty CPUs of a corporate overlord. 

#### Control Over Look and Feel
I believe in the basic principle that we should have agency over our online digital identities. Aesthetics are part of this. I like (at minimum) being able to pick my own damn color scheme! I also like being able to add some other fun little formatty bits to make it feel more custom. DIY Digital (DIYD) Baby! 

#### Control Over Data
This is tricky because it will never be perfect. I'm sure my data is being stolen in some way as you read this. I do, however, feel like no one can be as evil as Meta Musk. If this platform is even 5% less sketchy I'm down.

#### Artistic Promotion
As a digital artist, isn't it [pretty funny](https://youtu.be/Jne9t8sHpUc?si=8DGtKBHk9wfuDDrW) that I've never had a personal website that actually showcases my work! I've been calling myself an artist for almost 25 years. My CV has been on my website but very little info about each project. I like seeinig other artists works.

#### Response to Fleeting Social Media Content
I'm trying to counter the transient nature of posts and stories on social media platforms - the constant stream of endless data.
**The loss and doom that one feels while scrolling.**

#### Nuanced Reflection of Self
I want to be transparent about who I am and what I think. I want to be judged by my thoughts rather than the digital twin I craft of myself online. And frankly, I don't want y'all to see me. If you want to see me, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]]

#### Gradual Refinement of Ideas
This whole brain dump is also a place for me to refine ideas and grow projects that might otherwise lay dormant. This is a process of [[Learning In Public\|Learning In Public]].

#### Second Brain for Storage and Connections
Serves as an external repository for my thoughts - I forget stuff, these documents guard it a little better. Especially when I can back it up. If I lose my mind, you can train a robot to be me. Or ten robots! 

#### Learning / Sharing Tool
Great way to learn and share my knowledge with others. I got some tricks for ya!

#### Copyright Concerns
I'm concerned about my ideas being stolen when I post them online, though I understand there's a risk. My bigger worry is about AI scraping this site and ingesting me into their hive brain. It's cold in there!
