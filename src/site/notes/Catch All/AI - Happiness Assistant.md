### Overview
- An AI application that is designed to optimize human happiness and wellbeing.
- Each person is different and needs different things to be happy. 
- AI could be used to create posative experiences in our lives. 
- The more AI monitors our lives the more potential it has for help or harm. 

## Examples
- AI learns that we get happiness, motivation, energy, etc by connecting with others.
- It tracks our needs and those of our friends throughout the day and creates short moments of connection with friends at times that we need it the most. 
- Maybe it notices that we are both working on a project and need some motivation and so it starts a brief call and suggests we both watch something cool and talk about it for 5 minutes. 
- It notices that we are feeling lonely and sets up a connection with a friend who is also lonely or wants to be supportive. 
- Uses similar technology to the current attention exploiting models deployed by social media
