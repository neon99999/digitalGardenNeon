I began explorong [[Catch All/Artificial Intelligence\|Artificial Intelligence]] indirrectly in 2020 while building [[Catch All/DEEP DIVE\|Deep Dive]]. This was before it was extra easy to use and you actually had to make a bunch of API calls and know programming. At first I was facinated by how silly and uncanny it was. You would ask it something and it would spit back the most absurd things. 

When OpenAI realised ChatGPT to the public in 2022 that's when thigns really changed and I had a moment of "holy crap this is going to be big". Since then I have been playing the human guinea pig and finding different ways to integrate it into my life.  My reason for doing this is two fold, first I am curious how it can actually benefit me, secondly I see this as a public serevce where I place myself on the front line and see how this technology could impact the lives of those around me. As far as I know, there are still very few people that i know who are using it on a dialy basis. 


Ways I use it

**Glorified Spell checker: and editor**:  Even thoguh I enjoy writing and consider myself an OK writter, I still struggle with spelling, grammar and clarity, especially when writing about more complex things. I often put my text into ChatGPT 4 and say "correct for grammar and clarity". This simple prompt followed by my text often returns results that I am 70% happy with. I often find it's suggestions a little embellished or cliche so I have to go in a change a few things back. I sometimes ask it to reorder my paragraphs so that they flow better. 

**Offer my critical feedback**: I try to approach my thoughts from multiple angles, including considering different perspectives. Sometimes, I input my writing and ask the AI for feedback, to challenge my arguments, or suggest overlooked aspects. Typically, it yields 90% generic advice and 10% valuable insights, which I then weave into my writing in my own words.

**Learning about a topic of inteterest**: I have had some great success using ChatGPT as a learning tool. For example, the other day I went on a deep dive into Boroque music starting with an overall history, learning about key musicians, finding examples of Boroque themes in contemporary music, asking about the techncial details of a harpscicord, all within the same chat. I probably could have found all this information somewehre else on teh internet but this way of having a conversation and asking very specific answers and having them delivered in the way I like is very appealign to me. 

**Programming**: I have been using AI to help me write Python and C++ code for a while now and it has proven quite useful. I find that I have to be very patient, often asking multiple times for the same thing, but eventually it returns some gold and is allowing me to itegrate features that I would not have been able to do such as advanced error handling, parsing and database integrations.
