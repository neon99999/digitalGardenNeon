## Overview
A small quaint farm town where everything seems to be just peachy, except for something maybe errie learking on the outskirts....or maybe just everything is fine. 

One day a vetrenarian gets a call from an old farmer who most of the town don't really know. He goes to his weird house and finds that a farm animal, maybe an old cow or goat that is well past it's prime has given birth to a very weird baby animal that is super creepy.  

Bad/ weird things start happening around town. 
Many women in town become pregnant and begin giving birth to strange babies

The animal could be just a little weird and the starangeess could evolve over time or it could b real weird off the top. 
Snow horror 
Bloody snow puddle where the beast was born. 
If following in [[Story - Lovecraft - Dunchich Horror\|Story - Lovecraft - Dunchich Horror]]
the monster would grow over time and slowly be integrated or not into the communicty and world at large. 
It could stay hidden away growing and festering or it could just be oddly accepted into the society and  part of the world.  Obviously the more hidden the more possible sinister
Or maybe the timeline is shorter and it is born and then something else happens to escalate it. 

19:58 The thing that is originally born slowly grows more and more grotesque as the time passes.
