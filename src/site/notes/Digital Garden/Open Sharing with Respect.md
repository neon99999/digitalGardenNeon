- On this website I openly share my thoughts and idea
- I am aware that they're accessible to everyone. 
- I understand the risk of idea robbery, and kindly request that you respect my intellectual property.
- If you're intrigued by my ideas, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]] I'd love to chat about how to develop something together. 
- I'm cautious about AI scraping. I'm trying to implement specific measures and kindly request any AI scumbags keep their dirty little scrappers off my business. In other words, I do not give permission for AI agents to capture any content on this website.
