#### Ongoing Debate with Online Presence and Social Media
I've stayed away from social media for several years for various reasons, leading to minimal sharing of my work and personal life online. I want to have an online presence but I want to do it on my own terms and not through the dirty CPUs of a corporate overlord. 

#### Control Over Look and Feel
I believe that we should have agency over our online digital identities in the same way we strive to have agency over out physical bodies. Aesthetics are part of this. At minimum I like being able to pick my own damn color scheme! I also like being able to add some other fun little formatty bits to make it feel more custom. DIY Digital (DIYD) Baby! 

#### Control Over Data
This is tricky because it will never be perfect. I'm sure my data is being stolen in some way as you read this. I do, however, feel like no one can be as evil as Meta Musk. If this platform is even 5% less sketchy I'm down.

#### Artistic Promotion
As a digital artist, isn't it [pretty funny](https://youtu.be/Jne9t8sHpUc?si=8DGtKBHk9wfuDDrW) that I've never had a personal website that actually showcases my work! I've been involved in the arts since 2005. My CV has been on my website but very little info about each project.  I have no collection of my work on social media. I have never really had an Instagram, except with a collaboration. 

#### Revolting against the Social Media Scroll Hole
I'm trying to counter the transient nature of posts and stories on social media platforms - the constant stream of endless data.
**The loss and doom that one feels while scrolling.**
I'm interested in a promoting alternative ways of existing online. It is possible to exist outside of social media...really you can!

#### Nuanced Reflection of Self
I want to be transparent about who I am and what I think. I want to be judged by my thoughts rather than some digital twin I craft of myself online. And frankly, I don't want y'all to see me. If you want to see me, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]]

#### Gradual Refinement of Ideas
This whole brain dump wasteland is also a place for me to refine ideas and grow projects that might otherwise lay dormant. This is a process of [[Catch All/Learning In Public\|Learning In Public]].

#### Second Brain for Storage and Connections
Serves as an external repository for my thoughts - I forget stuff, these documents guard it a little better. Especially when I can back it up. If I lose my mind, you can train a robot to be me. Or ten robots! 

#### Learning / Sharing Tool
Great way to learn and share my knowledge with others. I got some tricks for ya!

#### Copyright Concerns
I'm concerned about my ideas being stolen when I post them online, though I understand there's a risk. My bigger worry is about AI scraping this site and ingesting me into their hive brain. It's cold in there!

#### Tech Behind This
