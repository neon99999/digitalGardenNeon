- Similar to the way human brains consist of interconnected networks that process information and pass it on to the next or to multiple or loop it back around.
- One example of an AI model with interconnected layers and nodes is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is commonly used for image recognition tasks. In a CNN, the input image is processed through a series of interconnected layers, each of which applies a set of filters to the image to extract features such as edges, shapes, and textures. The output of one layer is then fed into the next layer, creating a hierarchical representation of the image that becomes increasingly abstract and complex as it moves through the layers. Finally, the output is fed into a set of fully connected layers, which make the final prediction based on the learned features.
- The interconnected layers and nodes in these models can be difficult to interpret, as they may involve complex mathematical operations and transformations. However, they are essential for achieving high levels of accuracy and predictive power in many AI applications.
