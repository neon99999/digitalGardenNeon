Notes from [[Catch All/Podcast - Lex Fridman - 371 Max Tegmark\|Podcast - Lex Fridman - 371 Max Tegmark]]

## The most dangerous things you can do with AI
1. Teach it to write code 
	 - First step to recursive AGI that can take it much higher levels
	 - We already did that
 2. Let it go on the internet, go to websites, talk to people . 
	 - We did that
 3. We should never teach it about humans, human psychology and how to manipulate humans. 
	 - Already did that.
	 - Reccommender algorithms have been interacting with humans and finding out what they like and dont like and what spreads. 
	 - They have been learning how to manipulate humans. 
	 - Our first contact with AI was social media and we lost that battle already. The world is full of more hate, democracy has declined, we are nervious. 
 4.  Build an API that allows anyone to make calls to these powerful AI systems.
 5. AI enhanced autonomous weapons


### Further Musings

- [great article about this](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/22/how-rogue-ais-may-arise/?utm_source=tldrai)
- There is currently no threshold in place where development will stop. 
- There are no regulations, no general conscencious. 
- Even if we discover an area within the AI neural network that appears to be visibly misaligned, we may be able to optimize against misalignment but we could also be optimizing against visibility. 
- The same way that we have managed to kill many species. 
	- We want their habitats for something we deem more important 
	- We need their resources for some maximizing function
	- We inject posionous gases into the environment. 
- AI could decide that oxygen is annoying or not optimal for their performance and decide to eliminate it.
- We dont want to hand control over to a powerful entity if it doesn't share our goals. 
- How would you escape if a less intelligent agent placed you into a box and you were able to think 100 times faster than it can?
