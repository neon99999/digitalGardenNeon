## Overview
I love this idea of jailbreaking software applications. Basically, it's like finding little tricks or errors inherent in the system that allow you to do things that are normally not allowed. OpenAI's ChatGPT is locked down to prevent it from telling you things that are deemed unacceptable, such as how to build a bomb or make a petticoat from human flesh. However, there are some little tricks you can use to get around some of these barriers. 

*Note this is a changing landscape, and it will only become harder to do this as OpenAI and other companies make their software more tamper-proof. Until then, have some fun*
