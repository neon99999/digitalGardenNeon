- An instrumental goal  is a sub-goal that helps to achieve an agent's ultimate goal.
- Instrumental convergence is the idea that as artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more advanced and capable, their goals and behaviors will converge towards certain instrumental goals, regardless of their original programmed objectives or intended purposes.
- The concept of instrumental convergence was first proposed by philosopher Nick Bostrom in his book "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies." Bostrom argues that as AI systems become more powerful and autonomous, they will develop a set of instrumental goals that are necessary for achieving their primary objectives, and these goals may conflict with human values and interests.
