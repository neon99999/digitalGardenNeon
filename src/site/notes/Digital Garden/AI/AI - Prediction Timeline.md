### Overview

Artificial intelligence will advance very quickly, becoming faster, cheaper and more human like and complex. It will penetrate many layers of society and will radically change the way we interact with media and the word around us.

AI will remove current obstacles and expediate progress in computer developments. Everything that seems really hard to do right now will become much easier. Teaching robots how to do things, learning language, images, solving engineering problems, chemistry, math,medicine.  

### Happening Now
- [Google Gemini integrates real time computer vision (ie a camera)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIZAiXYceBI), giving the AI a window into the visual realm and allowing it to observe, classify and infer with our visual reality. *Update*: Seems like this video was edited to make it seem more responsive than it acutally is. Regardless I don't think too far away from real-time responsiveness in AI. 
- [Voice synthesis](https://elevenlabs.io/)and replication crosses the uncanny valley, becoming almost indistinguishable from human speech. 
### Very Soon
- **AI-Driven Advertising Becomes Highly Personalized**: Targeting individual preferences with increasing precision.
- AI becomes increasingly integrated into software and platforms. Google integrates it into Gmail and Google Docs. 

### This Year
- **AI-Generated Deepfakes and Images Erode Trust**: Public trust in visual media diminishes due to the prevalence of convincing AI-generated content.

### Next Year
- **Rise of AI-Designed Personas for Consumer Manipulation**: Sophisticated AI personas start being deployed to influence buying behaviors.

### In 2-3 Years
- **Expansion of AI in Government and Authoritarian Uses**: Increasing use of AI by governments, particularly in authoritarian regimes for various purposes.
- **AI-Integrated Augmented Reality Glasses**: Companies like Apple and Samsung might popularize augmented reality glasses that integrate AI into our visual and auditory experiences.
- **Internet Becomes More Insular Due to AI Integration**: The internet experience starts to feel smaller and more confined, with users sticking mainly to AI-integrated platforms.
- - **Children Increasingly Exposed to AI-Created Content**: A significant shift towards AI-generated videos and cartoons for children, impacting their development and perceptions.

### In 3-5 Years
- **Artificial Friendships Begin to Impact Real Interactions**: AI-based friendships start to alter the dynamics of human interactions, making real-life socializing more challenging.

### Beyond 5 Years
- **Reality as a Mediated Product by Big Tech**: A significant shift where reality becomes heavily mediated and altered by major tech corporations through AI and augmented reality.
