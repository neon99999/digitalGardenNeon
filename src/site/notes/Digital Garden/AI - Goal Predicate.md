In artificial intelligence, a goal predicate is a statement that defines the objective or goal of an intelligent system in a way that is understandable to both humans and machines. A goal predicate typically takes the form of a logical statement that describes a desired state of the world or a set of conditions that must be satisfied to achieve a particular outcome.

For example, a goal predicate for an autonomous robot might be "deliver the package to the specified location." This statement defines the robot's objective in a way that is clear and unambiguous, and it can be translated into a set of specific tasks and actions that the robot must perform to achieve the goal.
