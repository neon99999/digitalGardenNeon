- "Ikigai" is a Japanese concept that combines the words "iki" (生き), meaning "life," and "gai" (甲斐), which represents "worth" or "value." It can be translated as "a reason for being" or "a reason to wake up in the morning." Ikigai represents the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. In essence, it's about finding a balance between passion, mission, profession, and vocation. The concept suggests that discovering one's ikigai can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life.
