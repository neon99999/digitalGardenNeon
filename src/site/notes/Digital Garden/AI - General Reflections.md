## General Thoughts

 - - We have the power to harness AI to help us to live more meaningful, rewarding, happy lives. We as humans can choose how we want to use this immense power. It can be made to exploit us or it can be used to make our lives better. 
- Sometimes we have to pause and ask ourselves why we are behaving the way we are? 
- Why do we need to create machines that replace the meaningful things we have in like art and communication and poetry and connection?
 - Human intelligence exists on a spectrum along with other biological entities. It is limited by the capacities of our brains, the speed at which we can think, the capacity of our memories, the limits of concurrent thoughts we can process, etc. 
 - We are at the most important fork in the road that humanity has ever faced. We are creating a species that is more intelligent than us and this could be the best thing that has ever happened to humanity or the worst
 - Our current version of AI - GPT 4 is so advanced, and still just a baby
 - There is a posibilty that humans may end ourselves with AI
 - There is a strong argument that GPT 4 should not be open source because it is too powerful and could fall into the wrong hands.
## What can we do?
- We need a unified pause to evaluate what we are doing.
	- This happened in human cloning, we could have pressed forward but we paused. 
- Place guardrails in place to protect us.
