## Overview
The concept of The Singularity revolves around the notion of AI reaching a point where it can autonomously enhance and upgrade itself. This process sets off a rapid, self-reinforcing cycle of improvement, where each iteration builds upon the last. The pace of these advancements is not just linear but terrifyingly exponential. Such a scenario envisions AI rapidly evolving at an unprecedented speed, each upgrade significantly more advanced than the previous, leading to transformative changes in a very short span of time.
