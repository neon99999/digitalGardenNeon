#### What is it?

- This is my personal website, digital garden, and second brain. Call it what you will; it's an extension of a reflection and note-taking practice I began in late 2022. It roughly follows the [[Digital Garden/Zettlecasten Method\|Zettlecasten Method]] This space will continue to evolve and refine as I add more notes and forge more connections. You can view my most recently updated notes at the bottom of the homepage.
  
#### My Approach to Online Presence

- **Ongoing Debate with Social Media**: I've consciously stayed away from mainstream social media, seeking an online presence on my own terms, not through the dirty CPUs of a corporate overlord.
  
- **Revolting against the Social Media Scroll Hole:** I'm on a mission to rebel against the fleeting lifespan of social media posts and stories - the constant stream of endless data. **The loss and doom that one feels while scrolling.** I'm interested in a promoting alternative ways of existing online. Very little conversation occurs around this topic. 

- **Artistic Promotion**: As a digital artist since 2005, I find it [pretty funny](https://youtu.be/Jne9t8sHpUc?si=8DGtKBHk9wfuDDrW) that Iâ€™ve only now created a personal website to showcase my work in 2024. Better late than never! 
  
- **Populating my future brain:**  This site serves as an external repository for my thoughts - I forget stuff, these documents guard it a little better. Especially when I can back it up. If I lose my mind, you can train a robot to be me. Or ten robots!

#### The Philosophy Behind My Digital Space

- **Control Over Look and Feel**: I believe that we should have agency over our online digital identities in the same way we strive to have agency over out physical bodies. At minimum I like being able to pick my own damn color scheme! Digital us should be as unqiue as we are. DIY Digital (DIYD) Baby! 
  
- **Control Over Data**: Acknowledging the challenge of data privacy, I aim for a less intrusive platform,  If this platform is even 5% less sketchy than the likes of Meta Musk I'm down!

- **Authenticity:** I want to be judged by my thoughts rather than some digital twin I craft of myself online. Frankly, I don't want y'all to see me on vacation or drinking a Bellini at Earls. I'm really charming in person anyways! If you want to see me, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]]

#### The Method to My Madness

- **Zettelkasten Method**: My site roughly follows the Zettelkasten method, organizing and connecting thoughts like a personal Wikipedia for ideas.
  
- **Tech Behind This**: Using Obsidian, along with Ole Eskild Steensen's "Digital Garden" plugin and Vercel for hosting. 

#### My Perspective on Content and Sharing

- **Nothing Published is Final**: Embracing the evolving nature of ideas, I share everything from half-baked musings to deep thoughts.
  
- **Level of Certainty**: Sharing my certainty level, inspired by [Joschua's Notes](https://notes.joschua.io/50+Slipbox/Level+of+Certainty), allows transparency and encourages me to share without over-filtering.

#### Intellectual Property and Privacy Concerns

- **Copyright Concerns**: I'm sharing lots of stuff here. I understand the risk of idea robbery, and kindly request that you respect my intellectual property. If you're intrigued by my ideas, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]] I'd love to chat about how to develop something together. I'm cautious about AI scraping. I'm trying to implement specific measures and kindly request any AI scumbags keep their dirty little scrappers off my business. In other words, I do not give permission for AI agents to capture any content on this website.
