##### **Overview**
A a group of innocent young nuns and one [[Digital Garden/old stuboorn nun\|old stuboorn nun]], go for a weekend getaway to [[Catch All/HolyLand Bible Camp\|HolyLand Bible Camp]] in the woods. 

What awaits them is three nights of sinful pleasure, culminating in a steamy encounter with a cruscified [[Catch All/Christ-Hermit\|Christ-Hermit]] that inhabits the hills. 

# General Plot

A group of 5-12 nuns head out of town to a country get away
the begging makes the film feel like a period piece because inside the nunnary can look very old and be very formal
When they get out the film can feel more contemporary but maybe still weird or timeless. 
Maybe they have some nun phone that is connected to a local nun network and global social network
This is modern times, the nuns are all a little weird but they may have secret cell phones with hilarious funny weird [[Catch All/nun apps\|nun apps]]

The nuns go for a walk to collect mushrooms (while making jokes about magic mushrooms, but becoming increasly apparetnt that maybe some of them had done them before, but they continue to make stronger and stronger innuendos and funny references..."talking to saint peter")

Nuns get accidentally drunk / high and mistake everyday objects for signs of holy presence which culminates in one of them, maybe [[Digital Garden/old stuboorn nun\|old stuboorn nun]] getting it on with the hermit.
