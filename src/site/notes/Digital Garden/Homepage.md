# Greetings Visitor! 
![Garden-31.jpg](/img/user/Attachements/Garden-31.jpg)
My name is **Matthew Waddell**.

I am an artist and educator based in Calgary, Canada.

Welcome to my digital village - an evolving experiment in building alternative online spaces where I share my work, interests, and personal musings on life.

This might be a bit different from your typical artist's website, and you may leave knowing more about me than you ever wanted to. 

There are many pages to explore but here's some points of departure.
