##### **Overview**
An obervational documentary exploring the sport and lifestyle of bull riding in Alberta. following an Alberta bull and a rider or a few bulls as they prepare for a competition or maybe just as they go about their business and live their lives. 

### Why this topic interests me
- Bull riding is one of the most intense sporting acitivites in the world. WHere else do people tie themselves to a massive, angry, testigos tied beast as it violently bucks and throws itself around. 
- Alberta has a history of the cowboy and Stampeed that is complex and controversial and ongoing
- The bull riding industry is often overlooked and generally misunderstood. 
- The lives of the cowboys remain mysterious


### Elements
No narration, beautiful camera shorts, great sound. 
Maybe use GoPros to mount on various things like the rider or the bull. 
Close up trying hands and tying bulls balls. 
Attach a camera to bulls legs, riders helmet, saddle 

Beautiful sound of the animal and the breath and the leather and anticipation 
Not romantisizing the experience
observing, not judging
Enter without an agenda. 

##### **Themes**
Link to the cattle industry 
Milk cows 
The cowboy 
Career of a modern cowboy 
The dying act of bull riding. 
Masculinity 
Fragility
