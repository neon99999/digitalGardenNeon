##### **Overview**
A tale about an AI program that unknowingly summons a deep dark curse from the past. The curse posses the summoner so it enters into the AI program and fuses it's ancient evil with the power of a super computer. 
An alternate [[Digital Garden/The Singularity\|The Singularity]] pathway where AI doesn't evolve on its own but rather becomes possessed by an external supernatural force that takes advantage of its complexity and power to unleash countless horrrors on the world. 

Need some way to keep the horror at first confined to the digital realm without it necessarily influencing the human world. Maybe the evil doesn't even know that it is inside a computer, or maybe it doesn't care or doesn't even function like that. 

### Quesitons
- Is #horror dependant on the human body and the fear of human death?
- How does an ancient evil interface with modern technology?
