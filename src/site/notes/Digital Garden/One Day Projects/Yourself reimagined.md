### Overview
A multi-channel video installation, suitable for a gallery or public space, magnifies the mundane, transforming everyday human gestures into intimate, romanticized, or cinematic moments. The tone could range from serious to amusingly absurd.

Positioned in a public area or gallery, one or more video cameras use machine learning to capture close-up shots of individuals engaging in ordinary activities like walking past, waiting for a bus, or sitting on a bench. These shots are then replayed in slow motion, with dramatic editing, music or across multiple screens, to create a cinematic experience from ordinary moments.

The installation adopts a voyeuristic yet appreciative and respectful approach to observing people. It aims to highlight the beauty and complexity of everyday life and human interactions in mundane situations. It encourages viewers to be more present and to realize that everyone possesses inherent beauty. Additionally, it serves as a response to the curated and increasingly artificial self-portraits prevalent on social media.
