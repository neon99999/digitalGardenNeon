## Overview
A video or compact electronic device designed to perform religious duties on behalf of an individual. This could range from offering prayers to turning a prayer wheel, or performing acts of submission.

## Concept
This concept serves as a humorous commentary on the notion of redemption and the various ways individuals navigate or circumvent their religious obligations. It draws parallels to practices like the continuously running elevators that stop at every floor on Saturdays for observant Jews, or the notion of seeking last-minute absolution from a priest on one's deathbed to cleanse sins and secure a place in heaven.

Questions the link between faith, convenience, and the essence of religious commitments.
