##### **Overview**
A public art installation where individuals can enter their birth date and see the estimated time until their death displayed as small lights, each represesnting one week of life remaining.  

##### **Concept**
"No matter how many times you do something, there will come a day when you do it for the last time" 

Visualizing the potential time we have left in our lives is a way to live in the moment and not take any day for granted. 
You leave your date behind so the next person sees your time remaining and can refelct on it. 

### Presentation
Should look stunning regardless if you know the concept or not. 
Small lights arranged in a sculpture or above people's heads like a starscape. Each light is a week of life. 

*Bask in the fading glow or take solumn in the darkness of the past*."

A sculpture of a small child holding hands with an old person gazing up at the lights in reflection. 

### Questions
What is the difference between light bulbs and LEDs? 
Symbolically? You have to replace light bulbs
