https://www.allmusic.com/
Allmusic has probably exposed me to more music than any other online resource. As a teenager in the late 90s this website (pared with Napster, and then Kazaa and then what.cd) was an absolute mind blowing experience. I could find one band I liked and then instantly see 10 more similar bands. Who would have thought there was so much music out there!?

[Radio garden](https://radio.garden/)
Thousands of live radio streams from all over the world. An absolute gem and endless source of amusement. 

[Radio is a foreign country](https://www.radioisaforeigncountry.org/)
A real real good station playing all non-western music all the time. One of my favourite places to listen. 

https://roulette.org/rtv/
Long running Roulette TV has many performances by many cool musicians out of NY

[The Calgary Cassette Preservation Society](http://www.calgarycassettes.org/)
A massive collection of Calgary albums dating back to the 50s. So many great bands from my youth here. What an amazing resource!

[Performance Practice Of electroacoustic Music](http://ppeam.zhdk.ch/song/professor-bad-trip-lesson-i/)
A cool resource for contemporary music and graphic scores.
