### Overview

The Zettelkasten method is a way of organizing knowledge by writing down individual ideas or pieces of information on separate notes, and then linking these notes to each other based on how they relate. It helps in building a network of interconnected ideas, which can lead to new insights.

To understand this method, think of it as a garden. Each note is like a seed planted in its own spot. As you add more notes, you link them like plants in a garden, grouped by similarity or relevance. This network, like interconnected roots, helps your ideas grow and interweave, leading to a rich and flourishing garden of knowledge.

### Reflections

I have been taking notes and journaling extensively since 2002. I started with paper journals, then migrated to Evernote where, since 2008, I have collected a whopping 5,000+ individual notes. This turned out to be quite counterproductive for my creative process. I became a note hoarder, but nothing was really sticking or making connections. I learned about Obsidian and Zettelkasten from my friend Craig, and in the summer of 2022 I started slowly transferring my notes over to Obsidian - well actually I just started making new notes. Since then, I haven't looked back. It really has changed the way I gather my thoughts and think about thinking.
