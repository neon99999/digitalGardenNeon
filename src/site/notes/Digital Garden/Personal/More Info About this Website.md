### About this site

- This is my personal website, digital garden, and second brain — essentially my first public attempt at a note-taking practice I've been engaged in for the last 15 years or so. It roughly follows the [[Zettelkasten Method\|Zettelkasten Method]]. It will continue to evolve and refine as I add more notes and create more connections. You can view my most recently updated notes at the bottom of the homepage.

- **Artistic Promotion**: As a digital artist since 2005, I find it pretty funny that I’ve only now created a personal website to showcase my work in 2024. Better late than never! 
  
- **Populating my future brain:**  This site serves as an external repository for my thoughts - I forget stuff, these documents guard it a little better. Especially when I can back it up. If I lose my mind, you can train a robot to be me. Or ten robots!

### DIY Digital 

- **Exploring Alternative Digital Realities**: I advocate for broadening the dialogue on different ways to exist online. This topic, often overlooked, merits deeper exploration and understanding.

- **Control Over Look and Feel**: I believe that we should have agency over our online digital identities in the same way we strive for agency over our physical bodies. At minimum, I like being able to pick my own damn color scheme! Digital us should be as unqiue as meat body us. 
  
- **Control Over Data**: Acknowledging the challenge of data privacy, I aim for a less intrusive platform,  If this platform is even 5% less sketchy than the likes of Meta Musk I'm down!

### Redefining Digital Identity

- **Authenticity:** I want to be represented by my thoughts rather than some slick looking digital twin I craft of myself online. 

- **More fleshed out ideas:** Instead of offering brief snippets that either vanish or get lost in the noise, I prefer to present my ideas as longer-form writings that can be organized and refined. I believe this method better represents how our minds actually develop thoughts over time. 

- I don't want y'all to see me on vacation or drinking a Bellini at Earls. I'm really charming in person anyways! If you want to see me, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]]

Social Media 
- **Ongoing Debate with Social Media**:I've intentionally steered clear of mainstream social media, seeking digitality on my own terms, not through the dirty CPUs of a corporate overlord.
  
- **Revolting against the Scroll Hole:** I'm on a mission to rebel against the fleeting lifespan of social media posts and stories - the constant stream of endless data. **the loss and doom that one feels while scrolling.**

### My Organizational Method

- **Zettelkasten Method**: My site roughly follows the [[Digital Garden/Personal/Zettlecasten Method\|Zettlecasten Method]], organizing and connecting thoughts like a personal Wikipedia for ideas.
  
- **Tech Behind This**: At the heart of this digital garden is Obsidian, a powerful note-taking application that allows me to create, link, and organize my thoughts easy-peezy. To publish this I am using a lovely plug-in by [Ole Eskild Steensen's](https://ko-fi.com/oleeskild) called "Digital Garden." The site is hosted using Vercel and Github. This entire website is costing me zero dollars.

### How I use Artifical Intelligence on this website

- I have been experimenting with AI for a few years. I am deeply intregeagued and simutentously horrified by it. I've written about my why I am engaging with it here.  [[Catch All/AI - Why I am engaging with AI Now\|AI - Why I am engaging with AI Now]] 
  
- **ChatGPT 4**: I use this for tasks like grammar and spelling checks and to make suggestions for better ways to structure and organize my written content, especially in more complex articles. Basically an editor. Unless specifically mentioned, all thoughts and concepts are my own, and not generated by the tool.

- **DALL-E**: The black and white images on this site were created using DALL-E within OpenAI. I debated doing this, but decided that having fun images that compliement my thoughts was better than only having text. I also want to create a vibe and images certainly help.

### My Perspective on Content and Sharing

- **Nothing Published is Final**: Embracing the evolving nature of ideas, I share everything from half-baked musings to deep thoughts.
  
- **Level of Certainty**: Sharing my certainty level, inspired by [Joschua's Notes](https://notes.joschua.io/50+Slipbox/Level+of+Certainty), allows transparency and encourages me to share without over-filtering.

### Safeguarding Ideas in the Digital Realm

- **Copyright Concerns**: I'm sharing lots of stuff here. I understand the risk of idea robbery, and kindly request that you respect my intellectual property. If you're intrigued by my ideas, [[Catch All/let's hang out!\|let's hang out!]] I'd love to chat about how to develop something together. I'm cautious about AI scraping. I'm trying to implement specific measures and kindly request any AI scumbags keep their dirty little scrappers off my business. In other words, I do not give permission for AI agents to capture any content on this website.
